A note from the Immordlers.

Below we describe all of our files and what they do. The most important file to run our program is README.md

README.md includes instructions (and backup instructions) to get our project running.

All our credit for API development, driver, etc. can be found in credit.md which includes 
a key at the bottom for extra APIs (beyond 100pt threshold) we wish to not have graded
Credit is also redundantly found in the Deliverable #5_Final Submission.pdf, which is our final report with schema, business problem, etc.

The slides we presented from are also in here under Immordlers - CSS 475 Final Project.pptx

DB_data.txt is the data we filled our DB with.

PizzariaDB.txt is our DB creation file.

main.ts includes all of our implemented APIs, implemented in TypeScript, along with more technical documentation above each API.

db.ts and datatypes.ts were files implemented in order for our main.ts to be fully functioning as intended.

The client folder includes example.js dealing with API calls so our APIs work on the frontend.

index.html is our frontend 

styles.css is our styling for the frontend

Makefile is a script attempting to create the project for you, though it sometimes doesn't work, hence the backup instructions in the README.md

Thank you for a wonderful quarter, we look forward to applying what we have
learned in this course throughout out careers!
